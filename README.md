# Description
A collaborative full-stack application that addresses a real-world problem using a robust back end with servers, databases, advanced APIs, and user authentication. This project builds on agile development methodologies, including GitHub for version control, project management tools, and Git branch workflow for feature and bug fixes. The application's front end is developed from scratch, emphasizing reinforced skills and a stronger foundation.

## User Story
As a coding bootcamp student, I want to collaborate with my team to create a full-stack application that solves a real-world challenge. This Fitness Workout Tracker (FlexFlow) application integrates a robust back end with servers, databases, advanced APIs, and user authentication. By starting the front end from scratch, our team aims to enhance our existing abilities, solidify our understanding of front-end and back-end dynamics, and leverage our improved skills gained in recent weeks. The project will showcase problem-solving skills, crucial for future development role interviews.
